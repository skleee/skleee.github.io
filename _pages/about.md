I'm a Ph.D. candidate in the Data Intelligence and Learning Lab (DIAL Lab) at Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU), Korea. I received my M.S. degree in Artificial Intelligence from SKKU in 2023. Previously, I earned my B.A. in Economics and B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering, also from SKKU, in 2021. I am primarily interested in Information Retrieval, focusing on generative models for search and recommendation. My broader research interests encompass data mining and natural language processing, particularly their applications to real-world problems.
